### What I learnt

-I followed this tutorial to refresh myself on Javascript as I am looking to become more confident with it. It was interesting to see the switch statement being made use of for both the click and keydown events.
-It was also the first time I have added audio or animation, I hadn't realised how simple it would be to add audio.
-The tutorial touched on callbacks, this is something I still need to look at further to be confident in my understanding.
-I also plan to continue refreshing myself on the fundementals of Javascript like for and while loops, I understand how they work but coming mainly from a ruby background I need some more practice to get the syntax more readily available in my head!
